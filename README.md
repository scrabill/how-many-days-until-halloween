# 9 Days!

Ahhhhhhhhhh! We're getting close to the end of Hacktoberfest, so I wanted to make a few notes.

- I am working on reviewing and merging the existing pull requests (there were over 100 in the past week!)
- Please, _please_ see if an issue/change you are looking to make had already been done. Adding to on something is fine, however duplicate PRs may not be merged. I try to review PRs in order of oldest to newest.
- Please make sure you are forking and working off of the current `master` branch and not a branch from a previous year. Because of the time involved, I will not be merging PRs for branches other than the current `master` branch.
- As long as you have registered for [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), any unmerged PRs will count towards your 4, unless, it is marked as invalid (ie, a spammy PR). Details on what this means can be found here: [hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details)
- Quality over quantity is the motto for this year.

That's it for now, boys and ghouls.
