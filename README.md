# How Many Days Until Halloween?

Idk. Let [this page][this] do the counting for you!

## 2018-10-11 update

Hey ghouls! It's been a few days since I've been on here, but I have not forgotten. I caught my first cold (or flu) of the season so I've spent the past few days catching up on sleep. I hope to be back up and running over the weekend. Then I'll get started on reviewing the very spooky additions you all have made to this project.

Thanks for your patience!
