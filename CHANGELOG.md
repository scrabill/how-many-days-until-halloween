## Update 10/19
Wooo! I've gotten most of the new pull requests merged into the master branch. I'm probably biased, but this page is looking pretty kooky! All changes are also live on the [interWEBS](http://shannoncrabill.com/how-many-days-until-halloween/).

A BIG sanderson sisters [thanks to everything who has contributed](https://github.com/scrabill/how-many-days-until-halloween/blob/master/contributer-list.md) so far!
