## Update 10/29

Quick update here! I was out of town of the weekend and will be reviewing as many pull request as as I can over the next few days. 

Don't worry if your pull request isn't reviewed/accepted until November. As long as the pull request is made "between October 1â€“31 in any timezone" it'll count toward getting the t-shirt. 

Another update coming soon!

## Update 10/26

Thanks again for everyone who has contributed.

## Update 10/19
Wooo! I've gotten most of the new pull requests merged into the master branch. I'm probably biased, but this page is looking pretty kooky! All changes are also live on the [interWEBS](http://shannoncrabill.com/how-many-days-until-halloween/).

A BIG sanderson sisters [thanks to everything who has contributed](https://github.com/scrabill/how-many-days-until-halloween/blob/master/contributer-list.md) so far!

## Update 10/17

Wow! I'm happy to see all the pull requests that are waiting for me to review. I'm working on reviewing all of them, merging where appropriate and providing feedback. I'll keep chugging away and will plan to have all changes push live by the end of the week. 

In the meantime...
