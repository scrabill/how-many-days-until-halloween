## Update 10/19
Wooo! I've gotten most of the new pull requests merged into the master branch. I'm probably biased, but this page is looking pretty kooky! All changes are also live on the [interWEBS](http://shannoncrabill.com/how-many-days-until-halloween/).

A BIG sanderson sisters [thanks to everything who has contributed](https://github.com/scrabill/how-many-days-until-halloween/blob/master/contributer-list.md) so far!

## Update 10/17

Wow! I'm happy to see all the pull requests that are waiting for me to review. I'm working on reviewing all of them, merging where appropriate and providing feedback. I'll keep chugging away and will plan to have all changes push live by the end of the week. 

In the meantime...
