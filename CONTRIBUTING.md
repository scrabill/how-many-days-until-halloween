# Contributing Guidelines #

## Current Status ##

We value and encourage the community to provide feedback on how we can make our Halloween site more aesthetically pleasing.

The project is a simple website that includes interesting information about the Halloween fest. It uses front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.

We use the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/scrabill/how-many-days-until-halloween/issues?state=open) to track our issues. One can see the progress made on a particular issue and the discussion on any issues.

### How does it work?

It's simple - all you need to do is visit our [page][link] which will do all the counting for you!
